    "Imagine we wanna insert node 8 into the heap, but **OOPS 🤦‍♀️😕** this is a Min-Heap, ya remember in the Min-heap case, all the children values gotta be smaller than the parents nodes? So, to solve this issue, we need to Swap the nodes and walk up untill we reach to the place in correct order fashion! "
